QUESTIONS: 

1. Should we be outputting the data frame at every step through our Data Wrangling? This seems a bit tedious... (for us and the reader...)

2. How carefully should we be explaining our code cells? More or less than we are right now?

3. Should we include forward selection and comparison of forward selection vs. initial parameters, or should we just mention it and include the results from doing it.

4. Is it bad practice to overwrite variables, e.g. when updating a table (good example: "season data".)

5. 


NOTES:

1. Maybe for end discussion: we can talk about our assumptions?
    - that positions are unrelated to experience or age - seems reasonable at the professional level (but in recreational games, point guard is kind of the senior position.) 
    
DISCUSSION:

1. How important is each predictor?

2. We later discovered additional data that estimates how much time a player spends in each position. Further exploration could involve building a regression model to predict the percent of time a player is estimated to have played in their stated position for a given year.
