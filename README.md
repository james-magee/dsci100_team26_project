# draft 2

Ideas for draft 2:

- Give large summaries of what we *will* do in the code, but don't interweave as many markdown cells in the code.
    result: probably won't work. We end up with two many words, and should probably explain as we go along.
    

Ideas for draft 3:

- Re-interweave descriptions
- Write from the perspective of having done all the work we have. I.e. don't even think about comparing all 5 positions, just talk about this at the end? (i don't like this as much. I think it's best to compromise and show this in the Exploratory Analysis (as done in this draft (2)).
From the Jupyter Server Menu:
git -> clone_repository -> enter github info -> done






Going forward, to create a new draft:

1. Make a new branch

2. Push to that branch, and include updates in the README.md

3. When we all agree, we merge it to main
